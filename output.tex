Let's simplify the expression: $$4$$ Let's stop and think... 
Let's simplify the expression: $$x$$  
Let's simplify the expression: $$ \left( 4x \right) $$  
It turned out: $$ \left( 4x \right) $$ Aren't you feeling old. 
Let's simplify the expression: $$ \exp{  \left( 4x \right)  } $$ I think, its time to stop, but we must go on. 
It turned out: $$ \exp{  \left( 4x \right)  } $$
